# ERC721 Based Generated Project With GryPTo-3

This is a **ERC721** based generated project with **GryPTo-3**. Note that this project has not been audited and hence is not intended for production use.

The `contracts` folder has a sample crowdsale and token, with explicit points on where to override its behaviour.

## Setup

1- Install [nodejs and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

2- Clone the project by running `git clone git@github.com:OpenZeppelin/sample-crowdsale-starter.git`

3- Change directory into the project via `cd sample-crowdsale-starter`

4- Install dependencies by running `npm install`

## Tests

Tests are run via `npm test`. There are some pending tests waiting for you to implement the missing features, and make sure to write a test for every new feature you add!

## Docs
